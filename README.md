# About Aim Trainer
 
  Hello!
  This program aims to help users get better at their aiming skills.
  This program spawns 100 by 100 pixels on display at random coordinates on the screen. 
  If clicked in a fast manner, the square turns completely blue, if clicked in time but not in the "fast" time frame it just flickers blue.

  This is my first project using raylib, and as of now, I'm actively working on it!
