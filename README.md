# About Aim Trainer
 
  Hello!
  This program aims to help users get better at their aiming skills.
  This program spawns 100 by 100 pixels on display at random coordinates on the screen. 
  If clicked, the square will turn blue and a ding sound will play

  Note: This is my first project using raylib, and as of now, I'm actively working on it!
